    "(4) To address my question, I will use a bar graph visualization. I will compare total playtime across ages and identify any trends. This method is appropriate because the question is exploratory. The bar graph accumulates values of total playtime so patterns are easy to spot. This is also effective because the data contains many same-age observations. It requires assumptions that that playtime is completely accurate. However, this graph has limitations. There are far many more younger players that the trend may not be accurate. The graph itself not account for other factors or individual variation (a single user's high playtime could result in a high total playtime). Since the method is exploratory and predictive, the most important factor is to select the best summary method. I will clean the data before creating my visualization by removing rows with missing data. "
